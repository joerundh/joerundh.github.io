# CRAFTSVILLA

## Notes

- Changes were made from the designsystem in Figma to the implementation. Most noteworthy being the gallery, which in the end resembles more the look in the wireframe.

- Furthermore, the booking page has been conceptually changed from that in the wireframe, where items were meant to be ordered alongside time booking. Now, items for sale are viewable in a separate page, and the booking simply implements Google Calendar. The drasticity of this change is debatable.
