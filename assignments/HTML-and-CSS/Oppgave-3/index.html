			<h1>Mars</h1>
			<p>A planet once not too different from our own, this rock now seemingly only carries life in fiction. Nonetheless, for millennia it has played cultural role nearly unequaled, and with developments in science and technology has been the subject of ever-increasing amounts of study, as well as a favoured candidate to become a new world.</p>

				<p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun counting outwards, and the second-to-smallest. It is a rocky planet, easily recognizable by its reddish colour, which may even be noticed when viewed in the night sky from Earth.</p>
				<h3>Prehistoric interest</h3>
				<p>Its modern name comes from the Roman god of war, likely due to its colour being easily associated with blood. Being easily visible and recognizable in the sky, however, its motion is attested to have been observed and recorded by the ancient Egyptians more than 4000 years ago (over a thousand years before the founding of Rome). The Babylonians as well, around 600 BC, themselves presumably making note of its colour, associated it with the god of war, death and decease, Nergal. They also made systematic observations of its orbit, even inventing mathematical techniques to compute corrections to the predicted orbit.</p>
				<h3>Role in the Keplerian Revolution</h3>
				<p>After the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe made more detailed measurements of the movement of Mars than had been done previously, his assistant Johannes Kepler used the data to infer that the planet moved in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. He also suggested that other planets did the same, and was furthermore able to formulate his three laws of planetary motion. Isaac Newton, in his magnitudal <i>Principia</i>, confirmed that these laws followed from his own three laws of motion, combined with his law of gravitation.</p>
				<h3>In fiction</h3>
				<p>Although the prospect of intelligent life on Mars is far-fetched, the concept of the "Martian" is a staple of the science fiction genre. In his celebrated <i>War of the Worlds</i>, in which conquest-minded extra-terrestrials come to Earth and commence a mass-slaughter of humans and the English, HG Wells chose Mars as their planet of origin. His reason was two-fold: Mars is the planet most similar to Earth (for all it's worth), and is thus the second-most likely planet on which life may have appeared; and in Wells' time, it was thought that Mars was older than the Earth, and so more advanced civilizations would have had time to develop and technologically prepare for outward expansion. As the second fact at least has been proven false, it now seems certain that any alien invasion of Earth will have to be conducted by a race originating in an altogether different Solar system, if not different galaxy. Nonetheless, the "Martians" have come down to stay, and have since birthed a galore of other alien races, hostile or friendly, in the minds of the creative.</p>
				<h3>As a travel destination</h3>
				<p>As Earthlings themselves see the need to expand their territory, all the while out own planet becomes increasingly taken already, "space travel" and "space colonization" gain increasing attention and dedication. Already since the 1940s, well before the Moon landings, it has been the hope of many a scientist to send rockets towards Mars for research purposes. These relatively modest ambitions have culminated in as of yet six rover missions successfully landing on the surface of Mars; two of these, <i>Curiosity</i> (launched in November 2011; landed in August 2012) and <i>Perseverance</i> (July 2020; Febraury 2021), both NASA achievements, are still on-going and active in exploration.</p>
				<p>At the same time, others wish to go beyond the goals of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, and work towards the ability to not just send manned missions to Mars, but to bring along enough equipment and resources for a prolonged stay and eventual settlement. This is the ambition of the Texas-based space and telecommunications company SpaceX, who for nearly two decades have made themselves noteworthy for their development in rocket technology and their applications of them. Results on Mars emigration are still on hold.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, at the same time as the other planets of the solar system. It is one of four planets of the Solar System classified as a terrestrial (rocky) planet (along with Mercury, Venus and Earth);</li>
					<li>Its diameter is around 6,800 km, roughly half that of the Earth (about 12,800 km). It is the second smallest planet overall (the smallest is Mercury, with a diameter of 4,900 km);</li>
					<li>Its atmosphere is thin, with only about one percent of the Earth's atmospheric pressure at ground level, and consists of 95% carbondioxide, about 3% nitrogen gas, and about 2% argon, with trace amounts of other gases, including oxygen and water vapour;</li>
					<li>The distinct orange-red colour stems from dust of iron(III) oxide which covers the surface and also floats in the atmosphere;</li>
					<li>While its core was still molten, Mars did possess a magnetosphere, which protected from solar winds and cosmic rays. This allowed for an atmosphere to form and to remain, and it is evident from geological formations that running water has been present on Mars, even for long enough time for hydraulic erosion to take place;</li>
					<li>As the core hardened, around 4 billion years ago, the magnetosphere eventually dissipated over a period of 50,000 years, and is now only evident from scattered pockets of strong magnetic fields. Having lost this protection from outside forces, the atmosphere was eventually swept away into space;</li>
					<li>The surface temperature on Mars ranges between about +20&deg;C and -150&deg;C (the numbers depend on longitude), as the atmosphere is too thin to maintain temperature and allows the heat from the Sun to escape. Thus, although the ratio of carbondioxide is much greater than in the Earth's atmosphere (0.043%), Mars' atmosphere is not dense enough for any significant greenhouse effect to take place;</li>
					<li>Much like Earth, Mars has a climate, a weather system, and seasons of the year. The seasons vary in length more than on Earth, due to the orbit of Mars being more eccentric, i.e. less circular that Earth's (with the exception of Mercury, Mars' orbit has the biggest eccentricity of all the planets), and so the distance between Mars and the Sun vary more greatly through the year (which on Mars is 687 days long);</li>
					<li>Mars has a north and a south polar ice cap. Both consist of a layer of water ice, about a kilometre thick, which in the winter is covered by dry ice as the carbondioxide in the atmosphere freezes. In the summer, the dry ice sublimes again;</li>
					<li>Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. Of relatively small size, Phobos is 27 km at the longest, while Deimos is 12 km in diameter (for comparison, the Earth's moon is nearly 3.500 km in diameter); it is possible that they were originally passing asteroids, which were subsequently caught by Mars' gravitational pull and went into orbit;</li>
					<li>Mars has probably the tallest mountain in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands 24 km tall and is in actuality a volcano;</li>
					<li>The atmosphere persistently contains detectable amounts of methane. As this is broken down by solar rays, a source of methane must exist which more or less continuously produces and releases it. The source is likely volcanic, but also speculated to be biological, say, decaying organic matter (which is indeed the most significant source of methane on Earth).</li>
