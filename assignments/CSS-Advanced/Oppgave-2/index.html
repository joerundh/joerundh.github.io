            <div>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The Irish language has thirteen consonants: b, c, d, f, g, h, l, m, n, p, r, s, t. They are on the whole pronounced the same as in English, though they all have dual quality, either <i>broad</i> or <i>slender</i>, which is determined by the quality of the surrounding vowels. For example, a broad <i>s</i> is pronounced as in English <i>'soon'</i>, while a slender <i>s</i> is pronounced like <i>'sh'</i> in the English <i>share</i>.</p>
                <p>Nine of these consonants can, for example in certain grammatical contexts, undergo a mutation known as <i>lenition</i>, or more colloquially <i>softening</i>. It involves exactly a softening in the pronounciation of the consonant.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Effects</h3>
                <p>The effects of lenition are as follows</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>b > bh - becomes either somewhat as <i>w</i> in English <i>waiter</i>, or as the <i>v</i> in <i>very</i></li>
                    <li>c > ch - pronounced either as <i>ch</i> in the German <i>Hochzeit</i>, or the <i>kj</i> in the Norwegian <i>kjele</i></li>
                    <li>d > dh - pronounced at the start of words as a voiced <i>ch</i>-sound, or as the <i>y</i> in the English <i>year</i>; otherwise it is largely mute</li>
                    <li>f > fh - becomes unpronounced</li>
                    <li>g > gh - pretty much the same as <i>dh</i> above</li>
                    <li>m > mh - same as <i>bh</i> above</li>
                    <li>p > ph - essentially the same as the English <i>f</i></li>
                    <li>s > sh - becomes an aspirate, i.e. <i>h</i>-sound</li>
                    <li>t > th - similar to or same as <i>sh</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Concerning the notation, in the Gaelic script, lenition is denoted by a dot over the consonant, which is generally not available in modern type-setting. Thus the choice, which arguably is a natural one, to denote it with a <i>h</i> following the lenited consonant.</p>

            <h2>How it came about, and examples</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>How it came about</h3>
                <p>Like all mutations in Irish, lenitions are remnants of sounds which used to be present in the words of the language in bygone days, but which are no longer present. When two sounds follow each other in a spoken language, a common tendency is that over time the pronounciation of one sound may effect that of the other. Such effects may include nasalisation, voicing, or addition of aspiration. This happens presumably because of inate pressure to make speech flow more easily (for example in certain social classes, or even geographical locations).</p>
                <p>Over time, certain sounds were dropped from the words. But somehow, the effects they had on the surrounding sounds stayed on.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <p>A concrete example of this is in the definite article <i>an</i>. Irish has genders masculine and feminine, and the singular definite article for each is spelled the same. However, attached to the feminine article is the effect that it <i>lenites the initial consonant of the noun</i> (given that it goes with a constant which can be subject to lenition). This is because the definite articles used to be different for the genders, and the lasts sound of the feminine article affected the pronounciation of the noun. When the articles eventually changed, the effect on the noun did not. In the case of the feminine singular definite article, this effect is exactly that of lenition.</p>
                <p>Take the noun <i>bean</i> (meaning 'woman', pronounced like the English "ban"), which is feminine. 'A woman' is simply <i>bean</i> (Irish has no <i>in</i>definite articles). The singular definite, given the above, becomes <i>an bhean</i> ('the woman', pronounced like 'un-van' in Englis, with emphasis on 'van'). To underscore the peculiarity of it, this is not just a colloquial or dialectal feature, this is <i>embedded in the very grammar</i>, as well as <i>common to all dialects of Irish.</i></p>
